Open source software projects with distributed teams are complex beasts with many dependencies, asynchronous communications, and endless moving parts.

In order to clearly demonstrate what's planned for OctoFi, we've decided to provide a super simple breakdown of the project roadmap, and set a precedent for clarity and transparency. 

## Portfolio

The homepage serves as a portfolio of sorts, with a series of projects that encompass the OctoFi ecosystem and its rollout. But in between major milestones such as Octoken, Aquafarm, and Tentacles, there are smaller but equally important deliverables. 

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 1
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/projects/project-octoken.jpg, /images/projects/project-aquafarm.jpg, /images/projects/project-tentacle.jpg
	"
%}

This post aims to demonstrate what lies ahead and very simply distill relevant information into different formats. This should hopefully ensure that the community remain on the same page as development, and that when we are transitioning to the Aragon DAO, everything of importance is captured clearly and concisely.

## Roadmap

The below table is a very simple roadmap that uses footnotes — like this one[^1] here — next to each project name. These link to further information beneath the table, where you can find a description and any relevant links.

Please note the progress bars are estimations made by us devevelopers upon each commit we push to our GitHub repositories.

If well received we may implement this simple roadmap on the homepage.
