Open source software projects with distributed teams are complex beasts with many dependencies, asynchronous communications, and endless moving parts.

In order to clearly demonstrate what's planned for [OctoFi](/), we've decided to provide a simple breakdown of the project roadmap, and set a precedent for clarity and transparency. 

## Portfolio

The [homepage](/) serves as a roadmap of sorts, with a series of projects that encompass the OctoFi ecosystem and its rollout. But in between major milestones such as [Octoken](/project/token), [Aquafarm](/project/aquafarm), and [Tentacles](/project/tentacles), there are smaller but equally important deliverables. 

This post aims to demonstrate what lies ahead (at time of writing) and very simply distill relevant information into different formats. This should hopefully ensure that the community remain on the same page as development, get involved with DAO at our [Snapshot Page](https://dao.octo.fi), and that everything of importance is captured clearly and concisely.

## Roadmap

The below table is a very simple roadmap. Further information and links available further down the page.

Please note the progress bars are estimations made by us devevelopers upon each commit we push to the GitHub repositories.
